# Adaptive Gradient Sparsification for Communication-Efficient Homomorphic Encryption in Federated Learning
# Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Models

This repository contains a work-in-progress implementation of a federated learning framework for privacy-preserving healthcare models using DistilBERT and simulated encryption. The goal is to develop AI systems that protect patient data while enabling robust healthcare predictions, with potential applications in neurosymbolic AI for ethical decision-making.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/privacy-preserving-healthcare.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install transformers==4.41.2 torch==2.3.0 ...` (see requirements.txt)
3. Open `Privacy_Preserving_LLM_Framework.ipynb` in Google Colab.
4. Configure Kaggle credentials to download the Chest X-Ray dataset.

## Current Status
- Implemented: Federated learning with DistilBERT, simulated encryption, Chest X-Ray dataset integration.
- In Progress: Homomorphic encryption integration, full paper documentation.
- Future Work: Extend to neurosymbolic AI for social cognition (e.g., bias mitigation in multi-agent systems).

## Relevance
This work aligns with neurosymbolic AI by combining neural (federated learning) and symbolic (encryption rules) approaches, with applications in privacy-sensitive healthcare and ethical AI.
